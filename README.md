# Math Prodigy Bot

Math Prodigy Bot is a smart Streamlit application that helps you solve math problems from screenshots with step-by-step explanations. Powered by [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) and OpenAI's o4-mini, the bot reads your uploaded image, understands the math problem, and generates a complete solution â€” optionally including similar problems for practice.
